<h2>Liquid Coffee Template Engine</h2>
<br />
<p>
    Liquid.coffee was ported from a fork of <a href="https://github.com/Shopify/liquid-old">liquid 2.2.2</a>,
    after which the following additions were made:

    <h5>Liquid Inheritance tags</h5>
    <ul>
        <li>block</li>
        <li>extend</ul>
    </ul>

    <h5>Liquid3 tags</h5>
    <ul>
        <li>break</li>
        <li>continue</li>
        <li>decrement</li>
        <li>increment</li>
    </ul>

</p>
<p>
    This library was created as a plugin for huginn and named huginn-liquid. It is still
    available on npmjs.org under that name. This site was generated with huginn using liquid.coffee.
    Since then, I've added a browserified distribution under
    the name liquid.coffee.js, which is suitable for use in single page apps. Examples of this
    usage can be found in the <a href="https://github.com/darkoverlordofdata/frodo">Frodo</a> app.
